        question: "What is VidyaLoans and how does it help students?",
        answer: "VidyaLoans is a digital-first, AI-powered education loan platform. We help students compare, choose, and apply for study abroad education loans from top Indian banks and NBFCs, guaranteeing the lowest interest rates and a 100% digital, stress-free experience."
    },
    {
        id: "gen-2",
        category: "general",
        question: "Are VidyaLoans services free for students?",
        answer: "Yes, our services are 100% free. We are a direct channel partner of lending institutions, which allows us to assist you throughout the application, document collection, bank coordination, and final disbursement process at zero cost."
    },
    {
        id: "gen-3",
        category: "general",
        question: "Which countries are covered under VidyaLoans?",
        answer: "We support education loans for all major global study destinations, including the USA, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Ireland, Singapore, New Zealand, and more than 20 other countries."
    },
    // Eligibility
    {
        id: "elig-1",
        category: "eligibility",
        question: "What are the primary eligibility criteria for a study abroad education loan?",
        answer: "The primary criteria include: Indian citizenship, age 18 years or older, secured admission in a recognized university or college abroad, and a co-applicant (typically a parent, guardian, spouse, or sibling) with a stable income source. Strong academic records and standardized test scores (like GRE, GMAT, IELTS, TOEFL) also enhance your approval prospects."
    },
    {
        id: "elig-2",
        category: "eligibility",
        question: "Can I get an education loan without a co-applicant?",
        answer: "Generally, Indian banks require a financial co-applicant (typically a close relative) who acts as a guarantor. However, for top-tier global institutions (such as Ivy League colleges or top-50 business schools), certain private lenders and NBFCs can offer unsecured loans based purely on your academic profile and estimated future earning potential."
    },
    {
        id: "elig-3",
        category: "eligibility",
        question: "Does my co-applicant need to have a high salary?",
        answer: "A co-applicant's income is critical for unsecured loans, as lenders use it to assess the repayment capacity if a student is unable to secure a job immediately. However, for secured (collateralized) loans, the income requirement is much more flexible since the loan is backed by a tangible asset."
    },
    // Collateral
    {
        id: "col-1",
        category: "collateral",
        question: "What is the difference between secured and unsecured education loans?",
        answer: "Secured loans require collateral (such as residential property, fixed deposits, or liquid securities) and typically offer lower interest rates (starting at 8.5% p.a.), longer tenures, and higher loan amounts. Unsecured loans do not require collateral, but approval depends heavily on your university's ranking, test scores, and co-applicant's CIBIL score and income."
    },
    {
        id: "col-2",
        category: "collateral",
        question: "What assets are accepted as collateral for a secured loan?",
        answer: "Lenders accept physical assets like residential houses, apartments, commercial properties, and non-agricultural land. They also accept liquid assets (often called paper collateral) including Fixed Deposits (FDs), mutual funds, government bonds, and life insurance policies with cash surrender value."
    },
    {
        id: "col-3",
        category: "collateral",
        question: "Can I submit multiple properties or assets for a single loan?",
        answer: "Yes, you can combine multiple properties or mix physical and liquid collateral (e.g., a residential property plus a Fixed Deposit) to meet the total required value of the loan or to secure a lower interest rate."
    },
    // Disbursement
    {
        id: "disb-1",
        category: "disbursement",
        question: "How is the loan amount disbursed?",
        answer: "The tuition fee component is disbursed directly to your university's official bank account on a semester or yearly basis, aligned with their fee schedule. Living expenses, health insurance, and travel costs are either loaded onto a prepaid international Forex card or transferred directly to the student's personal bank account."
    },
    {
        id: "disb-2",
        category: "disbursement",
        question: "What is a moratorium period?",
        answer: "The moratorium period is a repayment holiday granted to students. It typically spans the entire duration of your course plus an additional 6 to 12 months. During this period, you are not required to repay the principal amount, though depending on the lender, simple interest or partial interest may accrue."
    },
    {
        id: "disb-3",
        category: "disbursement",
        question: "What happens if my university fees change mid-course?",
        answer: "Most banks allow for loan re-evaluation or increment requests. If your tuition fee increases or your exchange rate fluctuates significantly, you can submit the revised university fee structure to request additional disbursement, subject to the lender's approval."
